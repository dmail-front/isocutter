## isocutter v0.1

This tools has been developped in a 6 hours rush.
I put it on github in case someone could find it usefull.

How to use

Open index.html in a Firefox or Chrome recent version
Browse an image and clic the button to get a zip file containing all parts of the image.

Each image part is a 64x31 lozenge optimised for an isometric tile game.
